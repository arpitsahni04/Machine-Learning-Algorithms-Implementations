# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Implementations

This Repo Contains Pure Numpy Implementations of some of the fundamental Models in Machine Learning. 
1. A Vectorized Numpy Implementation of a  Decision Tree Algorithm That works for n-nary features and Predictor Variables. 
2. A Vectorized Numpy Implementation of Hidden markov models that trains by calculating the Emission, transition and Initial probabilities for given Sequence data and then uses a DP implementation 
forward-backward Algorithm and viterbi algorithm for inference.
3. A Vectorized Numpy Implementation of Linear Approximation based Reinforcement Learning for obtaining the optimal policy for a car to reach a hilltop, given the car outright does 
not have enough energy to reach to the top. ( has to utilize both kinetic and potential energy to reach the top)
4. A Vectorized Numpy Implementation of Logistic Regression.
5.  A Vectorized Numpy Implementation of a Nueral Network with various activation functions,loss functions,initialization schemes and Autodiff functionality of Pytorch
